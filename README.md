## **Trip List App**

React.js | JavaScript | Web Development

A user-friendly packing list application developed using React.js, designed to help users organize and manage items they need for their trips. The app allows users to add, delete, and toggle items as packed, providing an intuitive interface to ensure nothing is forgotten when preparing for a journey.

**Key Features:**

 - Add Items: Users can easily add items to the packing list by entering the description and quantity.
 - Sort Items: The list can be sorted based on item description or packing status (packed or not), allowing users to quickly find and organize their items.
 - Toggle Packed Status: Users can mark items as packed by checking them off, with the app visually striking through the text for packed items.
 - Delete Items: Users can remove items from the list once they are no longer needed.
 - Statistics: The app provides real-time stats about the total number of items and the percentage of packed items.

**Technologies Used:**

 - [ ] React.js: Used for building the interactive UI and managing the app's state.
 - [ ] JavaScript (ES6+): For logic and state handling.
 - [ ] CSS: To style the app and ensure a responsive layout.

**Project Highlights:**

 - Interactive UI: Smooth, responsive design for adding, sorting, and interacting with packing list items.
 - State Management: Efficient state handling using React hooks (useState) for a dynamic and seamless user experience.
 - User Engagement: Engaging sorting options and visual feedback (strikethrough effect) make it easy for users to track their progress in packing.
